An clone and / or adjustment of https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/12factor-app/


Add an environment variable to Jenkins:
INSTALL_PLUGINS=openshift-client:1.0.3,another_plugin:the_version
Only works for Jenkins-ephemeral 
INSTALL_PLUGINS=openshift-client will take :latest version

Then the openshift-client-plugin will be installed
inside Jenkins. And this is the new way of working 
with pipelines.
